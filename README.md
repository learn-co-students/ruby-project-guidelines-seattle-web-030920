# Module One Final Project Guidelines

For your final project, we'll be building a Command Line database application.

## Project Requirements

Your models should have methods that answer interesting questions about the data. For example, if you've collected info about movie reviews, what is the most popular movie? What movie has the most reviews?

You should build out a CLI to give your user full CRUD ability for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a command line To-Do list. A user should be able to create a new to-do, see all todos, update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories, so that a to-do has many categories and categories have many to-dos.

5. Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working project.
      - Have an overview of your project.(2 minutes max)
6. Prepare a presentation to follow your video.(3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      - Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      - Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      - Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      - Present any code you would like to highlight.   
short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.

A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.
